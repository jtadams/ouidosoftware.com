                                Ouido's Customizable Automated Deal Flow Management is the heart of Ouido.  Ouido knows
                                your process and allows your deal to follow it's own unique path to closing because no two
                                deals happen the same way.  Get an offer before your deal is "active", not problem, simply
                                drag & drop the deal into "Offer Negotiations".  A deal falls through, with a simple click
                                you're right back to "Active Listing".

                                Ouido let's your schedule work by creating a recurring template.  Give yourself (or your team)
                                a weekly recurring deal to make 20 prospecting calls, or to send out 50 refrigerator magnets, whatever
                                prospecting approaches work for you.

                                daily, weekly or monthly views, you can focus on exactly what is important.  And each view
                                is printable to take it with you on the go.

                                Nearly all of Ouido's widgets are printable, just as you see them on the screen.  Filtered, sorted, etc. all
                                exactly as you have filtered the screen.
