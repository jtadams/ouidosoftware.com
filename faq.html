                        <p>
                            One of the best features of Ouido is how it both keeps your assistant and you on the same page. Ouido's dashboards
                            provide you the overview and focus you need, while also giving your assistant the step by step
                            instructions that lead them through your deal flow automatically.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This means fewer "what do I do next?" questions, and more focus for both of you.  Which is why we say
                            that Ouido will become your assistant's new best friend.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While Ouido is a great tool for individual agents, it is with teams where it really shines. With
                            tools like our "Filter me" button agents can filter any dashboard down to those items that they need to
                            focus on (tasks, deals, dates, etc.), and with another click of the button return to seeing the
                            whole team's perspective.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With Ouido's agent color-coding, your office manager and transactions coordinators will love being
                            able to quickly identify which agent's deals are closing, and who is behind on tasks.

                        <h4>Ouido's automation and unique approach to workflows can handle any process</h4>
                        <p>
                            That's a bold statement, but, it's true.  Ouido's templating system is not only easy to use,
                            it's incredibly powerful as well.  So powerful, in fact, that we like to say you're only
                            limited by your imagination.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With Ouido's advanced task scheduling you can ensure that tasks always happen at the appropriate
                            time (e.g. 5 days before closing).  Our unique task triggers can kick off the next step in your
                            process, or even move your deal into the right phase.  And, because Ouido lets you combine those
                            two things, you can move into a new phase, and trigger a specific workflow.  Imagine an offer is received
                            and you want that to trigger a counter offer.  With Ouido, simple create a task in your workflow
                            that moves the deal to the Offer Negotiation phase, and triggers the Prepare Counter Offer workflow.
                            Offer is being accepted, Create a task (e.g. "Accept Offer), that by-passes the Offer Negotiations phase entirely,
                            and moves the deal into a Closing Prep workflow.<br>
                            The capabilities of this approach make sure your process works exactly as YOU want it to.

                            The Ouido setup wizard was designed for one purpose, to get you operational as quickly as possible.
                            After aswering a few simple questions about your preferred approach and listing all of your active deals,
                            Ouido builds your templates, and moves each deal into the correct workflow, so you start out already
                            caught up. Don't believe us?  Check out this video where we prove it.

                        <p>
                            At Ouido, we understand that busy agents can't always spend the time to keep their systems up to date.
                            Most other software adds insult to injury by making "catching up" a tedious and laborious task, and heaven forbid,
                            that something happens that doesn't follow "their" process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With Ouido's non-linear process management you can move your deals to the correct phase
                            and workflow with either a simple drag and drop on the deal board, or by utilizing the "Nuclear Reset" option
                            on the deal dashboard.  We call it that because it's funny, not because it's anything to be afraid of.
                            In fact, it may become your favorite feature. Just pick the current phase and workflow, and presto,
                            you're deal is all caught up.

                            At Ouido, we understand that time is money, and even though we've made the process of building
