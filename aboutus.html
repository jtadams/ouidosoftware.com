            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Ouido was created based on a simple idea... <span class="hightlighttext">That Software should actually help you do your job, not get in the way.</span>
                That's why, when we designed Ouido, we threw out conventional thinking, and looked for a new way to solve
                a problem that has been attempted many times before.  Conventional wisdom suggests that a problem with
                many attempted solutions has probably been solved, but, we knew that if that were the case, people would
                "love" their software, but, most people merely "tolerate" their software because they don't believe there
                is a better solution.  <span class="highlighttext">Ouido will change your mind.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Ouido has create a brand new paradigm in process management.  No longer does ever deal have to "fit" into the
                pre-defined model, but, the process can change and adapt to meet the needs of your deal.  It someething
                we call Non-Linear Process Management, and it allows Ouido to adapt to the what is really happening in your deal, in real time.
            </p>
            <h4>
                We all know that no two deals happen the same way, so why does most software force every deal through the same process?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Ouido's promise to you is that you will never have to fight the software to reflect what is actually happening in your deal.

                The core team at Ouido has over 100 years of combined experience in corporate america.  While we may not
                have seen it all, we've definitely seen plenty.  Plenty of good.... and way too much bad.  That is why as
                we started this journey we set out to create <strong>the company that we've always wanted to work for</strong>.
                We take words like "family first" and "incentives" very seriously, and believe that the best way to be
                successful is to create a company culture that invites loyalty, inoovation, and pride.
            </p>
            <p>
                One way we do that is by ensuring that every employee participates in the success of our company.  We belive
                that there are no small roles, only small actors, and that every role plays an important part of our success. Ouido
                is always looking for new representatives, so if you're interested, click the link below.
