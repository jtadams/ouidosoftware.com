                                A good assistant keeps you and your deals on track, and moving seamlessly through your process.
                                That is exactly what Ouido does for you.  Can it save money?  Let's assume you pay an assistant
                                $15/hr.  That's over $31,000/year, so at $79.95 per month, Ouido can save you over $30,000 per year.
                                And Ouido doesn't take vacations or require benefits!

                                Have you ever had to give up a commission to save a deal? Ever have to buy a refrigerator because
                                something got missed?  If not, you're among the elite, becuase it happens all the time.  And why?
                                usually because something slipped through the cracks, or a date was missed.  Ouido's sole purpose
                                is to keep you focused on what needs to happen NOW, and can even send reminders so you don't miss
                                critical dates,
                            </p>

                                Can we promise you'll never lose another commission?  No, but, using Ouido will significantly reduce
                                the risk of tasks and dates falling through the cracks.

                            <p>
                                If you're overwhelmed by the number of deals you have, understand that too many deals is a
                                great problem to have - More Deals = More Commissions!  That said, it can be overwhelming
                                keeping up with everything that needs to happen when you're working five, 10, or even 20 or more
                                deals simultaneously.  Ouido is designed to "know" what needs to happen on all those deals at any
                                given moment, so you don't waste time spinning your wheels or scratching your head about what to do next.

                                Truer words were never spoken.  Which begs the question, why does most software force all deals
                                through the same process?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is what makes Ouido different.  We think about process in a brand new way.  Ouido has
                                been designed to let each deal take a unique course through your custom process.  Templates
                                and workflows can be added, removed, changed, or whatever your deal requires, in real-time,
                                on the fly, and without ever having to fight the software to catch up. Ouido adapts to
                                the reality of your deal in real-time.  It's something we call Non-Linear Process Management.

                                becomes the best trainer you have because the system teaches your process by doing.  And Ouido
                                saves you time be reducing the "what do I do next?" barrage of questions that new team members often ask.

                                Not everybody works the same way, or thinks about things the same way.  Yet most software
                                expects that everyone approaches deals the same way.  Ouido, at it's heart, is a process
                                management engine, that allows you to create your own unique process for Deal FLow Management. But,
                                you don't have to start from scratch, Ouido comes with pre-designed templates and workflows that are
                                fully functional and can be used as is, or modified to suit your particular needs.

                                Ouido's dashboards allow you to visualize your data in the way that works best for you.  Do you
                                prefer a consolidated dashboard of everything you need to do? Or maybe you prefer a "kanban" style
                                approach, either way Ouido has a dashboard to provide that perspective.  And all Ouido
                                dashboards are filterable to limit the view to exactly what you're looking for at any moment.

                                While Ouido is a great tool for individual agents, it is with teams where it really shines. With
                                tools like our "Filter me" button agents can filter any dashboard down to those items that they need to
                                focus on (tasks, deals, dates, etc.), and with another click of the button return to seeing the

                                With Ouido's non-linear process management you can move your deals to the correct phase
                                and workflow with either a simple drag and drop on the deal board, or by utilizing the "Nuclear Reset" option
                                on the deal dashboard.  We call it that because it's funny, not because it's anything to be afraid of.
                                In fact, it may become your favorite feature. Just pick the current phase and workflow, and presto,
                                you're deal is all caught up.

                                Most deal management software is designed for every deal to follow the same basic process.  Sounds logical
                                and reasonable, except that most deal management software make it very difficult to deviate from that
                                process.  So when a deal takes an unexpected turn, like an offer negotiation falling through, you're stuck.
                                You either have to click hundreds of times to "fake out" the software, delete the deal and start over, or
                                worse, start working off-line because it just wasn't worth the effort to get the software to handle
                                the unique situation.

                                Ouido was designed specifically to solve this issue.  Our Non-Linear Process Management approach
                                ensures that Ouido can keep up with your deal seamlessly, no matter what happens, and it's as
                                simple as a drag & drop on the deal-board.  If you want a little more control, say to start in the
                                middle of a process, just use the "Nuclear Reset" option from the deal dashboard.  It sounds scary,
                                but it's not.  It simply lets you pick the exact template and workflow that matches the current
                                state of your deal.  A few clicks and your deal is back on track, no matter what the situation.
